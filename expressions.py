5 # a primitive integer-valued expression
5 * 7 # a more complex integer-valued expression
(4 * 6) / 9 # a float-valued expression
eggCount = 6 + 8 # example of a variable assignment
eggCount # evaluating a variable
eggCount / 2 # a float-valued expression - a divide will always return float
eggCount // 2 # an integer-valued expression - this is because of floor division operator
